Optimal Resale Price Estimation

LIMITS:
	-Sell tech products at the start (laptops, Smartphones, tablets)

	-Stick to historical transaction market data exclude external trend or sentiment signals
	Exclude (for now):
		-Desktops (custom builds break comparability)
		-Wearables (low resale liquidity)
		-Consoles (supply shocks dominate)
		-Accessories as price fluctuates and is mostly likely bundled
		
	- No free-text conditions descriptions or images when identifying your object

No photos
POTENTIAL MARKETS
 - eBay
	Pros
	- Explicit sold vs unsold
	- large volumes of tech products
	- Publicly accessible
	- Timestamped prices
	Extracted data
	- Final sale price
	- Listing start date -> sold date to find time-to-sell
	- Item specs
	- Condition
	- Whether the listing expired
	Concerns (Important)
	- eBay prices include:

 - Swappa (electronics only)

	- Do not train probability-of-sale models on it alone
- Amazon Renewed
	Use only to 
	- Establish an upper-bound reference point
